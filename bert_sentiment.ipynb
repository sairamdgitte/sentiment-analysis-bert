Through all the things that our workplace is putting us through - cuts, redundancies, cuts to research time, the constant threat of the latest 'change proposal'. I am sick of the structural inequalities that are not being addressed, that many women have found themselves with a tripled workload at work and at home - and they are constantly being called upon to do the caring work at the university - a place that is literally making them sick. That people of colour and Indigenous people are doing much more work in their communities to keep people afloat. At the same time RMIT is constantly asking for more - more 'impactful' research (with less and less time to do it). More innovative teaching - when the tools we have to do this are so limited. We are being berated for poor scores when students are fed up with structures at the university (class sizes, on and off campus) and so teaching staff are on the front line of their ire.

Establishing new teams, new ways of working, understanding the demands and work required, is harder than ever with everyone under so much stress and not functioning to full capacity.  Added to this is the different personal situations and pressures.

There are not enough hours in the day, self-care is basically impossible, the demands are unceasing. The pressure is relentless, and has a direct impact on my mental and physical health. Any time I have taken away has left me feeling more pressured as the team is not coping in a still unstable environment and after the prolonged stress of Covid and restructures. I have continued to work during illnesses as I felt immense pressure to do so as any other times of leave has resulted in significant donwturn of team functioning, caused in part by the exhaustion of team members and the impact it is having on their ability to function.
